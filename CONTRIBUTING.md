# Contributing to bezier-react
Welcome to bezier-react. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Make Pull request
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. (Recommanded) Commit with 'commitizen(cz-cli)'. Just run command `npm i commitizen -g` and you're ready to go. Commit with 'git cz'.
See also: [cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
6. Push to your forked repository.
7. Issue that pull request (from forked repository to origin).

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/channel-io/bezier-react/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/channel-io/bezier-react/issues/new/choose).
