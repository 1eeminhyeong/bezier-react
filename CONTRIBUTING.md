# Contributing to bezier-react
Welcome to bezier-react. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Make Pull request
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. (Recommanded) Commit with 'commitizen(cz-cli)'. Just run command `npm i commitizen -g` and you're ready to go. Commit with 'git cz'.
See also: [cz-cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
6. Push to your forked repository.
7. Issue that pull request (from forked repository to origin).

## Commit Convention
We are using commitzen as described above.
In more detail, it follows the [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type). You will add what kind of commit belongs to using the commitzen, and the types are as follows.

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

> Note that not all types make the resease start immediately. Only `BREAKING_CHANGE`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf` will be released immediately. See also: [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/faq#how-can-i-change-the-type-of-commits-that-trigger-a-release)
